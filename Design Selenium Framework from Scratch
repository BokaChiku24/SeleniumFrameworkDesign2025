Design Selenium Framework from Scratch

1) Why Gramework? Its advantages
2) Create Maven Structured Framework with all necessary Automation dependence
3) Select Sample Ecommerece Application to Automate the end-to-end flow.
4) Imlement Page Object Maodel mechanisum to drive the locators from respective class
5) Drive object creation withing Page Object Class encapsulation if from Test
6) Create Base Test which set browser configuration details and Global properties.
7) Decide the Test Strategy how test should be clubbed & distributed with appropriate annoations
8) Create TestNG runner file to trigger the test with one SIngle point of execution control
9) Introduce Grouping in TestNG.xml to categorize tests with different tags of execution
10) Implement Data driven & Parameterization testing using testNG data provider HashMap & JSON File reader
11) Implement TestNG Listners to capture Screenshot on automatic test failure & logging
12) Create extent report wrapper to generate excellent HTML report for the application
13) Make framework necessary changes to support parallel execution with Thread safe mechanisum
14) Implement TestNG retry mechanisum to rerun the failed lanky in the application
15) Run the framework with the mvn commands
16) Implement mvn runtime variable to replace global variable in the framework
17) integrate the framework with Jenkins with parameterize build pipeline jobs & Schedule job on specific time.
18) Add cucumber wrapper to existing framework with Cucumber TestNG Runner.
19) Create cucumber feature file & step defination to support cucumber execution of selenium.
20) Understand how cucumber tag, data driven & parameterization works in running test
